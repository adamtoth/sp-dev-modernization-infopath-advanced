# SharePoint Modernization scanner #

### Summary ###

Using this scanner you can prepare your classic sites for modernization via connecting these sites to an Office 365 group (the "groupify" process), modernizing the pages and in case of a publishing portal designing a modern publishing portal. This scanner is a key tool to use if you want to prepare for modernizing your classic sites.

> **Important**
> Checkout the [Modernize your classic sites](https://aka.ms/sppnp-modernize) article series on docs.microsoft.com to learn more about modernization. [Connect to an Office 365 group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/transform/modernize-connect-to-office365-group) and [Transform classic pages to modern client-side pages](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/transform/modernize-userinterface-site-pages) are articles that refer to this scanner.

# What will this tool do for you? #

The main purpose of this tool is to give you a set of reports that you can use to:

- Assess which sites are ready for "groupify": this report will give you "groupify" warnings and blockers which you can use to scope the sites to "groupify" and plan the needed remediation work
- Understand which lists are not showing up in modern, why that's the case and what you can do about them
- Learn more about the site pages used in your tenant: knowing which pages you have and their characteristics (type, layout, web part data, usage) is important to prepare for modernizing (a subset of) these pages
- Perform a deep analysis on your classic publishing portals: understanding your classic publishing portals will help you transform them to modern publishing portals

# Quick start guide #

## Download the tool ##

You can download the tool from here:

- [Modernization scanner for SharePoint Online](https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-modernization/blob/dev/Tools/SharePoint.Modernization/Releases/SharePoint.Modernization.Scanner.exe?raw=true)

Once you've downloaded the tool (**SharePoint.Modernization.Scanner.exe**), copy it to a folder. Next start a (PowerShell) command prompt and navigate to that folder so that you can use the tool.

## Using the scanner for SharePoint Online ##

Since this tool needs to be able to scan all site collections it's recommended to use an app-only principal with tenant scoped permissions for the scan. This approach will ensure the tool has access, if you use an account (e.g. your SharePoint tenant admin account) then the tool can only access the sites where this user also has access. You can either use a an Azure AD application or a SharePoint app principal:

- [Granting access via Azure AD App-Only](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/solution-guidance/security-apponly-azuread)
- [Granting access via SharePoint App-Only](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/solution-guidance/security-apponly-azureacs)

Once the preparation work is done, let's continue with doing a scan.

### Scanning SharePoint Online environment ###

#### Using the built-in wizard

When you run the scanner executable without specifying command line parameters a wizard will show that walks you through the needed steps to collect scanner configuration data. Once all data has been collected the scan will be executed. This approach is the easiest if you don't like to configure a potential complex command line. Below is an image showing the wizard in action:

![wizard](wizard.png)

#### Using the command line

Below option is the default usage of the tool for most customers: you specify the mode, your tenant name and the created client id and secret:

```console
SharePoint.Modernization.Scanner.exe -t <tenant> -i <clientid> -s <clientsecret>
```

A real life sample:

```console
SharePoint.Modernization.Scanner.exe -t contoso -i 7a5c1615-997a-4059-a784-db2245ec7cc1 -s eOb6h+s805O/V3DOpd0dalec33Q6ShrHlSKkSra1FFw=
```

The above use will run all scanning options, but you can also target the scan via the `Mode` parameter (-m):

```console
SharePoint.Modernization.Scanner.exe -m <mode> -t <tenant> -i <clientid> -s <clientsecret>
```

A real life sample:

```console
SharePoint.Modernization.Scanner.exe -m GroupifyOnly -t contoso -i 7a5c1615-997a-4059-a784-db2245ec7cc1 -s eOb6h+s805O/V3DOpd0dalec33Q6ShrHlSKkSra1FFw=
```

#### Supported scanner modes ####

Mode | Description
-----|------------
`Full` | All components will be included, omitting -m has the same result
`GroupifyOnly` | Only use the Office 365 group connection readiness component, this component is part of each scan
`ListOnly` | Includes a deep list scan + includes the Office 365 group connection readiness component
`PageOnly` | Includes a scan from wiki and web part pages + includes the Office 365 group connection readiness component

### Key takeaways from this report
Load the ModernListBlocked.csv into Microsoft Excel and use below filters to analyze the received data

Filter | Takeaway
---------|----------
**No filter** | Will give you **all** the lists for which the default view page will not present itself using the "modern" UI. The number of lists can be very high because not all lists are designed to use the "modern" user interface. This data is however useful to assess the impact of upcoming "modern" changes: e.g. this report will tell you that x lists are not showing in modern because feature y is not available...if you know that feature y will become available in the future you can assess how many additional lists will then be able to present themselves using the "modern" user interface.
**Blocked at site level = TRUE or Blocked at web level = TRUE** | Using this filter you'll get all the sites where the "modern" ui blocking site/web scoped feature was enabled. It might be that this was done because certain sites were not yet ready for "modern", using this data you can disable the "modern" ui blocking feature again.
**Blocked at list level = TRUE** | End users do have the option to turn on/off the "modern" experience per list and using this filter you'll learn where that happened. The column "list experience" will show which setting was applied.
**Only blocked by OOB reaons = FALSE** | Will give you all the lists which are not rendering in "modern" because of a reason you can influence. If you want to improve the "modern" user interface compatibility of your SharePoint Online lists then these are the lists you can work with. 
**Only blocked by OOB reaons = FALSE and (Blocked by JSLink = TRUE or Blocked by XslLink = TRUE or Blocked by Xsl = TRUE or Blocked by JSLink field = TRUE)** | These are all the lists which are not showing in modern because their rendering is impacted by the existence of custom JavaScript or XSL. You could remove the references to these JavaScript and XSL files and go back to the out of the box way of list rendering or alternatively you can use column/view formatters or custom SharePoint Framework development.
**Only blocked by OOB reaons = FALSE and Blocked by list custom action = TRUE** | If a list custom action is embedding JavaScript then that will prevent rendering of the "modern" user interface. You can remove this list custom action or alternatively you can use column/view formatters or custom SharePoint Framework development.
**Business data fields = true or Blocked by task outcome field = true or Blocked by geo location field = true or Blocked by publishingField = true** | Although you can't fix the rendering of these fields you do have the option to remove them from the list default view which will fix the list "modern" rendering.

Since each web part has different **relevant** properties the properties that are exported for a web part are defined in the `webpartmapping.xml` file: this allows you to add/remove properties based on your needs. Each defined property is exported and stored underneath the "Properties" property as shown in below complete example:

```JSON

# Advanced topics #

## I only want to scan a few sites, can I do that? ##
Using the urls command line switch you can control which sites are scanned. You can specify one or more url's which can have a wild card. Samples of valid url's are:

 - https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/portals*
 - https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/hrportal
 - https://contoso-my.sharepoint.com/personal/*

To specify the url's you can use the -r parameter as shown below:

```console
SharePoint.Modernization.Scanner -r https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/portals*,https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/hrportal,https://contoso-my.sharepoint.com/personal/* 
                                 -i 7a5c1615-997a-4059-a784-db2245ec7cc1 
                                 -s eOb6h+s805O/V3DOpd0dalec33Q6ShrHlSKkSra1FFw=
```

An alternative model is specifying the url's inside a CSV file and then using the -f parameter as shown below:

```console
SharePoint.Modernization.Scanner -v "c:\temp\files.csv" 
                                 -i 7a5c1615-997a-4059-a784-db2245ec7cc1 
                                 -s eOb6h+s805O/V3DOpd0dalec33Q6ShrHlSKkSra1FFw=
```

A sample file would look like this:

```console
https://contoso.sharepoint.com
https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/test1
https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/test2
```

## Can I generate the Excel reports for existing scan data? ##

You can do this by specifying the folder(s) with already existing scan data using the -g parameter. The scanner will concatenate the data from all passed folders and will generate the needed reports. The "Page transformation Readiness" report will only be generated if the relevant data is available.

```console
SharePoint.Modernization.Scanner -g <paths>

SharePoint.Modernization.Scanner -g "c:\temp\636529695601669598,c:\temp\636529695601698765"
```

## I'm running SharePoint with vanity URL's (SharePoint Online Dedicated), is this different? ##

In SharePoint Online Dedicated one can have vanity url's like teams.contoso.com which implies that the tool cannot automatically determine the used url's and tenant admin center url. Using below command line switches you can specify the site url's to scan and the tenant admin center url. Note that the urls need to be separated by a comma.

```console
SharePoint.Modernization.Scanner -a <tenantadminsite> -r <wildcard urls> -i <clientid> -s <clientsecret>
```

A real life sample:

```console
SharePoint.Modernization.Scanner -a https://contoso-admin.contoso.com 
                                 -r "https://teams.contoso.com/sites/*,https://portal.contoso.com/*"
                                 -i 7a5c1615-997a-4059-a784-db2245ec7cc1 -s eOb6h+s805O/V3DOpd0dalec33Q6ShrHlSKkSra1FFw=
```

## I want to use an Azure AD app to authenticate, how do I that? ##

This scanner, like all scanners built using the SharePoint Scanner framework, do support Azure AD App-Only:

```console
SharePoint.Modernization.Scanner -t <tenant> -i <Azure App ID> -z <Azure AD Domain> 
                                 -f "<Path to PFX file holding your certificate" -x <Password for the PFX file>
```

A real life sample:

```console
SharePoint.Modernization.Scanner -t contoso -i e4108e9b-9865-44a9-c6e1-9003db04a775 -z contoso.onmicrosoft.com  
                                 -f "C:\scanning\AzureADAppOnlyScanning.pfx" -x pwd
```

## I don't want to use app-only, can I use credentials? ##

The best option is to use app-only since that will ensure that the tool can read all site collections but you can also run the tool using credentials.

```console
SharePoint.Modernization.Scanner -m GroupifyOnly -t <tenant> -u <user> -p <password>

SharePoint.Modernization.Scanner -t <tenant> -u <user> -p <password>
```

A real life sample:

```console
SharePoint.Modernization.Scanner -m GroupifyOnly -t contoso -c admin@contoso.onmicrosoft.com -p mypassword

SharePoint.Modernization.Scanner -t contoso -c admin@contoso.onmicrosoft.com -p mypassword
```
