# SharePoint Modernization tools

The SharePointPnP.Modernization solution contains tools to help you with modernizing your classic SharePoint sites. 

## The SharePoint Modernization scanner

Using the modernization scanner you can prepare your classic sites for modernization via connecting these sites to an Office 365 group, modernizing the pages and in case of a publishing portal designing a modern publishing portal. This scanner is a key tool to use if you want to prepare for modernizing your classic sites. Next to that the scanner will also provide you data about your classic workflow and InfoPath usage as these are candidates to be reworked using Microsoft Flow and PowerApps.
